<h2>Description:</h2>
<p>
  This roasted chicken recipe is the way my grandmother used to make it. This method results in the juiciest chicken!
  <p>We loved to nibble on the celery after it was cooked.</p>
</p>

<h2>Ingredients</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Chicken: This recipe starts with a 3-pound whole chicken. If your bird is larger or smaller, you'll need to adjust the recipe.</li>
    <li>Seasonings: This roasted chicken is simply seasoned with salt, black pepper, and onion powder.</li>
    <li>Butter: Butter (or margarine, if you prefer) locks in moisture and gives the seasonings something to adhere to.</li>
    <li>Celery: Stuff the chicken cavity with celery for subtle vegetal flavor. Plus, the celery will release even more moisture as the chicken cooks.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Steps</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>
    <li>Place chicken in a roasting pan; season generously inside and out with onion powder, salt, and pepper. Place 3 tablespoons of butter in chicken cavity; arrange dollops of remaining butter on the outside of chicken. Cut celery into 3 or 4 pieces; place in the chicken cavity.</li>
    <li>Bake chicken uncovered in the preheated oven until no longer pink at the bone and the juices run clear, about 1 hour and 15 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the thickest part of the thigh, near the bone, should read 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).</li>
    <li>Remove from the oven and baste with drippings. Cover with aluminum foil and allow to rest for about 30 minutes before serving.</li>
  </ol>
